<%# This needs refactored to support the edit Items route -- this is the old partial for the location_items edit route %>
<%# There currently is no _items.html.erb.  This will not be implemented in the MVP %>
<%# this has been left here as a framework for future development %>

<%# render partial: "item", locals: {item: @item, url: item_path(@item)} %>
